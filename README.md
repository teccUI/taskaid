What we’re building:
A web-first, Firebase-powered task manager that lets solo professionals create a task and bucket it in under 60 seconds—no team collaboration, no bloated charts.

Target user:
25-plus-year-old knowledge workers who want a private, lightweight alternative to big project tools.

Core experience:

Email + strong-password sign-up with 7-day session persistence.

Clean two-pane dashboard—tasks on the left, user-defined buckets on the right.

Drag-and-drop tasks into buckets; live task counts and a collapsible “quick stats” bar (done-today, open, streak).

Mobile responsive: tabbed switcher between Tasks and Buckets; analytics bar hidden by default.

Must-have scope:

Task & Bucket CRUD with confirm dialogs.

Drag-and-drop, password validation, session handling.

Strong modal/undo safety net for destructive actions.
